## Installation
* Clone the repository to your local machine using the command ` git clone https://github.com/arthurW1935/car-rental-backend.git `.
* We recommend installing an IDE for this project. We used [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
* Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and set it up as per your operating system.
* Docker Installation Guide [Windows](https://youtu.be/WDEdRmTCSs8), [Linux](https://youtu.be/5_EA3rBCXmU), [Mac](https://youtu.be/-EXlfSsP49A).
* After installing Docker, ensure it is running. Then, navigate to your project directory and run the command `docker compose up` in the terminal. If you encounter any errors, check the `docker-compose.yml` file in the project directory for conflicting port usage.
* We recommend installing [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for testing api calls.
* Now, finally run the `CarRentalBackendApplication` present in your project directory to start the project.
